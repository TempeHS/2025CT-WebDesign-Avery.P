        <h2 style="color: white;"> Information about Mario</h2>
        <P style="color: white;"> Mario is a character created by the Japanese video game designer Shigeru
                Miyamoto. He is the title character of the
                Mario franchise and the mascot of the Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario is an Italian
                plumber who resides in
                the Mushroom Kingdom with his younger twin brother, Luigi. Their adventures generally center on
                rescuing Princess Peach
                from the villain Bowser while using power-ups that give them different abilities.</P>
        <P style="color: white;"> Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game.
                Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as
                the protagonist, but when he could not gain the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. The
                graphical limitations of
                arcade hardware influenced Mario's design, such as his large nose, mustache, and overalls. Miyamoto
                expected the
                character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video"
                and "Jumpman", he
                was renamed Mario after Nintendo of America's landlord, Mario Segale. After Donkey Kong, Mario starred
                in Mario Bros.
                (1983). Its 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System sequel, Super Mario Bros., began the successful Super
                Mario series.
                Charles Martinet voiced Mario from 1991 to 2023, when he was succeeded by Kevin Afghani.</P>

        <h2 style="color: white;">Why does Mario look like he does</h2>
        <p style="color: white;"> The graphical limitations of arcade hardware influenced Mario's design, such as his
                large nose, mustache, and overalls. His design has now become iconic inside the video game industry and
                outside of it too.</p>
